## Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) New tab Chrome Extension!

I really love space and astronomy pictures and for about 10 or 15 years I've had APOD as my home page! But I don't specifically see my homepage that much anymore and I've been missing out on my APOD fix.

So what did I do??? I built an extension to show me an APOD on every new tab I open!
